Project 1- Breast Cancer detection using Logistic Regression
    Logistic regression is a method of statistical analysis used to predict a data value based on prior observations of a dataset. A  logistic regression model predicts the value of a dependent variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.
    In data science, logistic regression is a Machine Learning algorithm used for classification problems and predictive analysis.
  What my model will do: 
    Predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics
  Steps to build model:
    Part 1: Data Preprocessing
              Importing the dataset
              Splitting the dataset into a training set and test set
    Part 2: Training and Inference
              Training the logistic regression model on the training set
              Predicting the test set results
    Part 3: Evaluating the Model 
              Making the confusion matrix
              Computing the accuracy with k-Fold cross-validation

Project 2- Bank Loan Defaulters using Kernel SVM classification
  What my model will do:
    Predict if the Customer is Defaulter to loan patment. Its a Classification problem.
  Steps to build model:
    Part 1: Data Preprocessing
              Importing the dataset
              Splitting the dataset into a training set and test set
              Checking imbalancing in Data Set for dependent variable
              resample Training data using SMOTE technique to balance data set
    Part 2: Training and Inference
              Training the logistic regression model on the training set
              Predicting the test set results
    Part 3: Evaluating the Model 
              Making the confusion matrix
              Computing the accuracy with k-Fold cross-validation
